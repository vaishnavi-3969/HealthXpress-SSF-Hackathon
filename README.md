This project is bootstrapped with Create React App.

Introduction :
Welcome to the project! This is a React application built using Create React App, a toolchain provided by Facebook for bootstrapping and setting up React applications quickly and efficiently.

Prerequisites :
Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

-Node.js (v12 or higher) - JavaScript runtime environment.
-npm (v6 or higher) - Node Package Manager.

Getting Started
To run the application locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

npm start
Run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Build the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
